# OmegaAI

This repository contains the code used to develop **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** that predict the presence or absence of **positive selection** from **multiple sequence alignments (MSAs)** of **protein-coding nucleotide sequences**, referred to as **OmegaAI**.  
It also includes scripts used to **simulate training data** for these models.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This repository is provided primarily as an **educational and reference resource**. It is not intended for direct production use.

### 🚀 Ongoing Work

An **AIBIOUK-supported extension** of this project is underway, exploring the use of **transformer architectures** for detecting positive selection from MSAs — replacing CNNs with attention-based models.

Further updates will be added to this repository as the project progresses.
